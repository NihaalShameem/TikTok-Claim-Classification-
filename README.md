# TikTok-Claim-Classification
## Project Overview 
The TikTok data team wants to develop a machine learning model to assist in the classification of claims for user submissions. This means to determine wheter a video was a claim or of opinion based. 
## Problem
Videos on TikTok recieve a large number of user reports for a lot of different reasons. This leads to all videos not being able to be reviewed by a human moderator. Videos that make claims (as opposed to opinions) are much more likely to contaim content that violates the platform's term of service. TikTok seeks to a way to identify videos that make claims to prioritize them for review. 
## Solution 
We ended up going through many stages that included `data preperation, data cleaning, A/B Testing, and lastly builiding multiple models` that will help predict wheter videos were of claims or opinions.
